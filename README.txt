With Node already installed on your machine, download all files.

cd through command prompt, until you've reached the project directory which should look 
similar to this: C:\your\local\path\website\project

from there, run the command "node index.js"

Then open your web browser of choice and type "localhost:8000" to view the web page

To exit the express server, return to the command prompt and press "ctrl + c"
